# **IA_P1**

## **Instructions**

In order to run the app, you need to have the streamlit library installed in your Python environment. If you don't have it, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
$ pip install streamlit
```

To run the app, simply type this command in the terminal:

```bash
$ streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser.

## **Usage**

The app is very simple to use. You just need to choose the file you want to run the optimization on and the algorithm you want to use. Depending on the algorithm you choose, you may need to set some parameters. After that, you just need to click the "Run initial" button to run the optimization from the initial solution and the "Run best" button to run the optimization from the best solution found so far.

## **Results**

The results of the optimization will be displayed in the app. You will be able to see the initial scores, the best scores found so far, and the scores of the last run.

## **Work Distribution**

The work was evenly distributed among the team members. Each member was responsible for implementing the algorithms and the app interface.
